# BrainBase Information Repository
The repository of information on a cerebrovascular physiology database.

# Purpose
The purpose of this database is to operationalize and streamline the organization, storage and accumulation of cerebrovascular physiology data from healthy volunteers and individuals with comorbidities ranging from a current or prior brain injury to those with cardiometabolic disease. Inclusion of data into this database will require a minimum standard set of variables, henceforth collectively referred to as priority data elements. However, this database is also amenable to the inclusion of additional cerebrovascular variables that may be collected at a lesser frequency as a part of individual studies included within the database in relation to their specific aims. These data elements will be henceforth collectively referred to as additional data elements.
